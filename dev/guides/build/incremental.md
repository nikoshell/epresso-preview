# Incremental builds & caching

epresso builds are **deterministic** (same source + config → same output) and
**incremental** (a content edit re-renders only the affected pages).

## How it works

- Every content entry has a **digest** over its body + data.
- The build records a dependency graph: each route depends on the collections
  and entries it consumed (via `get_collection` / `get_entry`).
- On the next build, routes whose dependencies haven't changed are **reused**
  from the cache instead of re-rendered.
- The cache is dropped wholesale when the *config* or any *template/component*
  changes — including a file in a [layer](guides/extending/layers.md) — so
  editing a component re-renders every route.

## Cache

The incremental cache lives in `.cache/` (gitignored; not removed by `epresso clean`).
A clean build (`epresso build --clean`) re-renders everything so side-effect
outputs (islands, assets, images) are regenerated.

## Determinism

Outputs use content-hashed filenames and stable ordering, so identical source
always produces identical output — ideal for caching and reproducible deploys.

## `epresso clean`

Removes `dist/` and the `.cache` build cache.

## Parallel rendering

Builds with 64 or more pages to render are split across worker processes, one per
CPU (up to 8). Workers are forked after the site is loaded, so they share the
loaded content and compiled templates; plugin html transforms still run in the
main process, in page order, so the output is identical to a serial build. Set
`[build] jobs = 1` (or `EPRESSO_JOBS=1`) to render serially, or a number to cap
the workers. Platforms without `fork()` (Windows) always render serially.
