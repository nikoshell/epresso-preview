# Plugins

Plugins extend epresso through a **capability registry**. A plugin is a named,
configurable object exposing lifecycle hooks; each hook receives a narrow
`Capabilities` handle — **never the raw `Site`** — so a plugin can only touch the
extension surface epresso exposes. Plugins are deterministic: deduplicated by
name, run in `priority` order, and re-loading a site never double-applies a
contribution. Bundled, runnable example plugins ship under `examples/plugins/`
(see [Bundled example plugins](#bundled-example-plugins)).

## Writing a plugin

Build a plugin with a **factory** so you can pass options:

```python
from epresso.plugins import Plugin

def greeter(*, text: str = "hello", shout: bool = False):
    def on_setup(caps):
        caps.add_global("greeting", lambda: text.upper() if shout else text)
        caps.add_filter("shout", lambda s: str(s).upper())
    return Plugin(name="greeter", hooks={"on_setup": on_setup})
```

A **subclass** style is also supported — `on_*` methods are collected
automatically:

```python
from epresso.plugins import Plugin

class Greeter(Plugin):
    name = "greeter"
    def on_setup(self, caps):
        caps.add_global("greeting", lambda: "hello")
```

## Capabilities

| Capability                | Valid in      | Effect                                              |
|---------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `add_global(name, value)` | `on_setup`    | expose a Jinja template global                      |
| `add_filter(name, fn)`    | `on_setup`    | register a Jinja template filter                    |
| `register_collection(...)`| `before_load` | add a content collection (via a loader) to the store |
| `add_markdown_extension(spec)` | `before_load` | register a Markdown extension (idempotent)      |
| `add_markdown_it_plugin(fn)` | any | apply a markdown-it-py plugin `fn(md)` (e.g. from `mdit_py_plugins`) to every Markdown renderer |
| `add_markdown_source_transform(fn)` | any | rewrite Markdown source before rendering (`str -> str`) |
| `add_markdown_render_transform(fn)` | any | `fn(md, src, depth) -> str` — for syntax that renders inner Markdown (tabs) |
| `add_layer(root)`         | `before_load` | add a component/layout/asset root after the site's own |
| `add_route(rel, file)`    | `before_load` | serve `file` as if it were `pages/<rel>` (e.g. `"[...slug].ep"`) |
| `add_static(dir, prefix, exclude=())` | `before_load` | publish `dir`'s non-Markdown files verbatim under `prefix`, minus the subdirs in `exclude` |
| `transform_html(fn)`      | any           | rewrite every rendered HTML page: `fn(html, ctx) -> html` |
| `inject_head(fragment)`   | any           | insert a fragment into `<head>` of every page      |

Each hook also receives `caps.config`, `caps.site`, and `caps.logger` (a
namespaced `[plugin:<name>]` logger; debug lines gate on
`EPRESSO_DEBUG=plugin:<name>`).

`caps.options` is the plugin's own `[plugin.<name>]` table from `site.toml`
(`{}` when absent). Core passes it through untouched, and `site.<env>.toml`
overrides it like any other key:

```toml
plugins = ["epresso_docs"]

[plugin.epresso_docs]
base = "/docs/"
```

Using a capability at the wrong time raises a `CapabilityError` with a hint —
for example, `register_collection` must run in `before_load` so the collection
is loaded before content, and `add_global`/`add_filter` need the Jinja
environment, which exists from `on_setup` onward.

## Layers vs plugins

For **components and layouts** that live in another package or repo, prefer
[layers](layers.md) — a declarative `[layers] use` entry with no code to write.
Reach for a plugin when you need build-time behaviour: template globals, HTML
transforms, content collections, markdown extensions. A package can do both.

## Registering a collection from a plugin

`register_collection` plugs a loader into the same store as `content.config.py`:

```python
def quotes(items):
    def before_load(caps):
        caps.register_collection(
            "quotes",
            loader=lambda: [{"id": "a", "data": {"text": "stay deterministic"}}],
        )
    return Plugin(name="quotes", hooks={"before_load": before_load})
```

Templates then read it with `get_collection("quotes")` / `get_entry("quotes", …)`,
exactly like a `content.config.py` collection.

## Transforming rendered output

`transform_html(fn)` runs a pure function over each rendered HTML route. `ctx`
carries `{"path", "params", "data"}` for the route (`data` is the route's
content entry, if any). The page cache stores HTML *before* transforms run, and
transforms re-run on reused pages too, so a transform never sees or leaves stale
output and doesn't turn incremental builds off:

```python
def watermark(text="Made by epresso"):
    def on_setup(caps):
        def transform(html, ctx):
            if "</pre>" not in html or "epresso-mark" in html:
                return html
            return html.replace("</pre>", f'<span class="epresso-mark">{text}</span></pre>')
        caps.transform_html(transform)
    return Plugin(name="watermark", hooks={"on_setup": on_setup})
```

Transforms are applied at render time in both build and dev. Because a transform
can depend on plugin code (not just content), a build that has any registered
transform re-renders every route rather than reusing a cached output — content
*body* caching still holds.

## Enabling

For **published** plugins, `uv add` the package and list it under `[plugins]` in
`site.toml` (dotted path — installable modules only):

```toml
plugins = ["epresso-greeter:greeter", "myorg:thing"]
```

For **local** plugins (or any that take options), add a `plugins.py` at the site
root that builds each plugin with its options and leaves `Plugin` instances as
module attributes:

```python
from greeter import greeter
greeting = greeter(text="hello from a plugin")
```

Options can only be passed via the code path (a dotted-path string cannot carry
them).

## Lifecycle & ordering

- Plugins are **deduplicated by name** — registering the same `name` twice raises
  a `PluginError`.
- Plugins run in **`priority` order** (lower first; ties keep registration order).
- Re-running a load/build is **idempotent** — contributions (globals, filters,
  collections, Markdown extensions, html transforms) are re-applied against a
  freshly built environment each load.

The lifecycle hooks, in order: `before_load`, `on_setup`, `after_load`,
`before_build`, `after_build(caps, result)`, `on_assets`.

## Bundled plugins

These ship with epresso; list them in `plugins = [...]` (the docs theme enables
the first seven). `EPRESSO_DISABLE_PLUGINS=a,b` turns named plugins off for one
build without editing `site.toml`.

| Plugin | What it does | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| `epresso_docs` | the `docs` collection from one or many Markdown sources | [below](#docs-from-several-sources-epresso_docs) |
| `epresso_blog` | blog: posts, paginated index, archive, categories, RSS (MkDocs-compatible) | [Blog](/guides/content/blog/) |
| `epresso_mkdocs` | MkDocs/Material Markdown syntax: admonitions, tabs, attr_list, snippets, … (`epresso_mkdocs_tabs` is an alias) | [Migrate from MkDocs](/guides/themes/migrate-from-mkdocs/) |
| `epresso_social` | `og:image` social cards | [Social cards](/guides/styling/social-cards/) |
| `epresso_optimize` | responsive WebP `srcset` for content images | [Images](/guides/styling/images/) |
| `epresso_pandoc` | Pandoc fenced-code / image attributes | — |
| `epresso_umami` | Umami analytics snippet (`UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID`) | — |
| `epresso_page_feedback` | "Was this page helpful?" widget on docs pages | — |

## Docs from several sources: `epresso_docs`

The bundled `epresso_docs` plugin owns a `docs` collection built from one or
more Markdown sources — local directories or git repositories — merged into one
sidebar, search index and prev/next chain:

```toml
plugins = ["epresso_docs"]

[plugin.epresso_docs]
base = "/docs/"                  # optional: docs under a path, inside this site

[[plugin.epresso_docs.sources]]
source = "docs"                  # local dir (relative to the site root)

[[plugin.epresso_docs.sources]]
source = "github:org/plugin-a@v1"
dir = "docs"                     # dir inside the source (default "docs" for git, "." local)
prefix = "/plugins/a/"           # URL prefix under base (default "/")
title = "Plugin A"               # sidebar group label
repo_url = ""                    # "view source" base override
```

Two sources producing the same page are a build error — give one a `prefix`.
Each source's images and other non-Markdown files are published under
`<base>/_docs-assets/<n>/`, so relative paths like `![](./img/shot.png)`
resolve (`dist/`, `node_modules/` and dot-dirs inside a source are skipped).
Under `base`, the host's `[markdown]` adopts the theme's code-block component
(`DocsHighlight`) unless the host sets its own `code_component`.
With `base` set, the plugin layers the docs theme under your site
(`theme = "path"` picks another) and serves its docs page; your pages, layouts
and global CSS are untouched. Without `base` the site *is* the docs theme, which
is what `epresso docs` and `docs.toml` build.

Behaviour worth knowing:

- **A prefix without an `index.md`** is a sidebar section heading only — no page
  is generated at that URL. Add an `index.md` to the source to give it a landing
  page.
- **The theme is brand-neutral.** It ships only its fonts (under
  `/docs-theme/fonts/`, a name no site uses), never a logo or favicon. A
  `logo.svg`, `favicon.ico` or `og-image.png` at a source's root brands the docs
  pages, unless `[theme] logo` / `favicon` / `og_image` is set. Under `base` the
  host's own favicon and pages are untouched.

Every source's files (images, downloads) are published, then after the build
only the files some built page, stylesheet or script references are kept.
Relative URLs resolve like MkDocs: Markdown `![]()`/`[]()` against the source
file, raw HTML `<img src>` against the page's own URL.

## Bundled example plugins

Ready-made, runnable example plugins ship in `examples/plugins/`. Each module is
a real plugin you can read and copy into your own project:

| Module         | Demonstrates                                                                  | Capabilities used         |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `greeter.py`   | factory style + options + template hooks                                      | `add_global`, `add_filter` |
| `quotes.py`    | a content collection contributed at load time                                 | `register_collection` (`before_load`) |
| `watermark.py` | a pure html transform stamping a “Made by epresso” pill on every code block   | `transform_html`          |

A runnable demo site in `examples/plugins/demo/` wires all three and builds a
small page. From the repo root:

```bash
uv run epresso build examples/plugins/demo   # then open dist/index.html
```

`demo/plugins.py` shows the recommended **local** enablement pattern:
`sys.path`-insert the folder, build each plugin with its options via a factory,
and leave the resulting `Plugin` instances as module attributes for epresso to
discover. For **published** plugins, `uv add` the package and reference it from
`site.toml` (see [Enabling](#enabling)). The demo output shows a shouted
greeting, a shouted filter value, two quotes from a plugin-registered collection,
and a “Made by epresso” pill stamped inside every code block.
